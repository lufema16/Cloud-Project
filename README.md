dht_test.py is an open source code I found to test if the temperature sensor is working correctly. 

Run iotcore2.py in the same file as the certificates and keys to send temperature sensor data from the raspberry pi to the AWS IoT Core

iotcore2.py should send temperature and time stamp of the reading to IoT Core. From IoT Core it should publish the message to AWS DynamoDB.
